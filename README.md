This Python script formats a legal document in Microsoft Word by:

✅ Adding spacing before each article.
✅ Making "Artículo X" bold.
✅ Setting the entire text to "Times New Roman" size 12. 

It was created to help a friend with document formatting at work. The script uses python-docx to process .docx files efficiently.

Though this is small and seems like nothing, this does 1/3 of the formatting job and saves a lot of time if the document has lots of articles.
